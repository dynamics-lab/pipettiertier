It will then move to the first well, dispense, touch tip and move to the next well doing the same before aspirating again. Due to the touch tip, however, the tip is vibrating strongly leading to an occasional collision with the wall of an 384-well plate. That in turn can lead to an offset of pipette coordinates until homing the robot again. "
